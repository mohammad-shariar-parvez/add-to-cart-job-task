Develop a food item section with an "Add to Cart" button for each item.
Ensure that clicking the "Add to Cart" button adds the correct item to the cart.
Implement a sidebar that displays added items with options to adjust their quantity and delete items.
Employ JavaScript for handling cart operations, including addition, quantity adjustment, price calculations, and item removal.
Prevent duplicated additions by disabling the "Add to Cart" button for an item once added to the cart.
Perform all operations asynchronously using JavaScript, ensuring a seamless user experience without page reloads.
Avoid using CMS platforms like WordPress, Wix, or similar tools for this task.
